## Design Pattern
For this API `layered_structure` was abopted for the main purpose of creating 
all the files in an order that could acomodate the rest easily. This structure was optimized 
as `scalable` and the best for the project decided by the developer. 
> Developer: "If I can get one path right, then the rest would be `cake`"
    
## **Soft Delete** 
This feature was implemented by adding an extra attribute to the Postit model called `deleted`
**Posts**
```json
{
    "post": "Soft delete feature",
    "ownerID": "640a12d5f6020fee349f8219",
    "deleted": false    // default: false
}
```
the delete `http request` in the controller is set to `PATCH` => updates deleted attribute in the post to true. 
**Posts**
```json
{
    "post": "Soft delete feature",
    "ownerID": "640a12d5f6020fee349f8219",
    "deleted": true
}
```
All get `Post` request in the db have been set to get request by `id` and `delete == false`. To prevent a user from calling a 
deleted request 
-     _await PostService.findOne({deleted: false})_
-     _await PostService.findbyID({ post: info.post, deleted: false })_

Deleted posts are treated as unexisting to the users on Postit but all initial data on the system are still intact.
   
**Detected Loophole**

1.     Deleted posts can still not be duplicated
2.     Recreation of a deleted post will throw an error because posts are unique
3.     Removal of post uniqueness to accomodate the last stated loophole will cause major redundancy with reason of eg that a client could click their create post button 5* due to a lagging device, slow intrnet... and have the same post created 5*, which would only cause such a client more pain

## **Validations**

**Joi Validation**
    `Joi` validation was used as my `schema validator` to validate all `req.body` data sent sent by the user to match my model before being sent to controller.js for use.

**JWT**
    `jwt token` for `login` authorization and specification too
>   installed `jsonwebtoken`

## POSTMAN Features Adopted
    
### Environment
    Used postman environment to keep url paths neat and simple
-   _env name_ => `DEV: post-it`
-   _variable_ => `USER` // {{USER}}
-   _initial value_ => `localhost:3838/api/v1/user/`

### Set an Environment Variable
    Automate authorizstion setting by setting your `jwt_token` to this an _env variable_

## Error Handler
    All route endpoints stored in `try/catch` to hold asyn and sync errors
    API probed to remain active under all circumstance.
    Ready for Deployment

## User AvatarUrl / Image Tag
A special feature was adopted in this api, giving a unique avatar to all users with information drafter
from their provided details, this feature was made possible using [`dicebear api`](https://www.dicebear.com/) to generate random avatars and return an `avatar url`. **Image Tag** was included in the user model to hold a `html` img tag for the avatar url.
